                What can I say. My personal website. I have created a logo and website from scratch. <br />
                It's hosted on my private VPS on CentOS. All is configured by me. 
                To work more efficient, I use multiple Subversion repositories hosted on this server. <br />
                Also I use it to talk with my mates via Teamspeak3.
