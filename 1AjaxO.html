                 Idea of this application is to control access of different users to web pages created in Adobe Edge Animate.Pages contains simply games(Adobe's or created by me in JS&HTML5) or pages of story. Those webpages we packed into modules of few games or story. These modules I am preparing to build with Phonegap to get Android, Windows Phone and iOS applications. I achieved that through the application written by me in Java SE. Application unpack the file, replaces comments with javascript code, adds required configuration files and again packs files into zip. These zip files are ready to build with Phonegap. In the end we have website and application for all key mobile platforms.
