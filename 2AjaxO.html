            Cinematographer production is an event promoting foundation in Poland, particularly
 in Silesia region. Apart of promoting them, they are organizing them from time to time. 
 <br />
 I have created a logo and designed the website. Then I have written a lightweight CMS based on Kohana to manage this website. Also I have created buisness cards in Illustrator for members and I have prepared them to print.
